# Naughts-and-Crosses
I created a game of naughts and crosses in C++ to get me more used to the language.  
I aim to keep updating this game to add complexity as I get more comfortable with the language.  
## <ins> Update ideas include: </ins>
- Adding and scoring rounds
- Increasing board size
- Increasing player capacity
- Creating a UI
